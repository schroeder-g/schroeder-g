### أهلا بك | Welcome | स्वागत हे  | Bem vindo | ようこそ  


----

A senior full stack engineer with a strong passion for innovation and a desire to tackle the challenges of tomorrow, I specialize in building distributed and disruptive solutions that make a meaningful impact in the world.

I extend existing technologies to transform outcomes for organizations and the public. My approach to problem-solving is grounded in first principles thinking and validated through Test-Driven Development, and I always look for opportunities to optimize and improve my code.

Beyond my time in the developer's chair, I am a science fiction writer,  and lover of probabilistic maths. When I'm not working on code, you can find me playing racket sports, hiking, or cooking up some vegan potato fritters.

Whether it's working on a moonshot project that seeks to solve tomorrow's most pressing problems, or simply discussing the latest advancements in tech and their potential to make a difference, I am always eager to connect with others who share my vision for a better future.
