### Bio

I build for a brighter future. As a full stack engineer, my passion is tackling distributed problems to solve the challenges of tomorrow. I specialize in building distributed and disruptive solutions that make a meaningful impact in the world.

I extend existing technologies to transform outcomes for organizations and the public. My approach to problem-solving is grounded in first principles thinking and validated through Test-Driven Development.

Whether you've got a moonshot project or want to discuss the latest developments in model architecture, let's connect.
